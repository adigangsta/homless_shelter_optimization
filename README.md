# homless_shelter_optimization
Nations all around the world encounter various social, economic, political, and security
issues that leave governments no choice but to step in and take action. In Montreal, homelessness
has been a major concern over the past couple of years and continues to be so at
an increasing rate. Homelessness reflects the social/economic problems that create unstable
housing conditions and poverty, leaving many on the streets. This produces a large number
of people who encounter daily physical, emotional, and mental struggles to survive that
start with obtaining food, clothing, shelter, and warmth. In fact, according to Homeless Hub
statistics, the total amount of homelessness in Montreal in 2018 was 3,149 [1]. The CEO of
Old Brewery Mission, James Hughes, states that this amount increased by 20% in 2020 due
to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Due to external pressures such as COVID-19, immense pressure has been put on the
capacity of homeless shelters in Montreal. In Montreal, there are three types of shelters
which are permanent housing, transitional housing, and emergency shelters. Many of the
homeless people mentioned above, did not choose to be on the streets and will be looking
for solutions to their situation. One option they will be looking for is an emergency shelter
that provides an escape from the streets and an instant state of relief. Another option they
would be looking at is a transitional shelter, that provides a period of support for people
who cannot pay their bills for a couple of months and need a temporary place to stay. In
an ideal world, all homeless people would find solutions and escape the reality they live in.
Unfortunately, that is not the case. Access to some shelters and transitional housing is not
easily accessible, while other shelters have demand greater than capacity. In fact, homeless
people in need of shelter get rejected at such institutions due to improper resource allocation,
where resources are wasted even when capacity has not yet been reached.

The aim of the project is to improve the efficacy of homeless shelter services for the
homeless population in Montreal. The goal of the optimization models is to minimize the
cost given the current capacity of homeless shelters while maximizing the number of the
accommodated homeless population. Some of the costs to be considered are the living
costs per person at each shelter (e.g., electricity, food, staffing costs) and fixed costs to run
operations in the shelters. This project will also recommend shelter locations to account for
the overflow demand. Gurobi has been used to solve the linear optimisation problem in Python
